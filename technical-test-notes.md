# Technical Test Notes

## Environment Setup

During the technical test, I prepared a local development environment using Docker Compose. The setup included the following services:

- **PostgreSQL**: For relational database storage.
- **Redis**: As an in-memory data structure store.
- **Elasticsearch**: For search capabilities.

I also created a `.env` file to manage environment-specific variables cleanly.
